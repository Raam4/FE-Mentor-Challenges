## My process

### Built with

- [Tailwindcss](https://tailwindcss.com/) - CSS framework

### What I learned

I learned to work with Tailwind and the 'Utility-First' approach.

### Continued development

I'm still uncomfortable with Tailwind workflow, but I like the way it handles styling and I'm excited to continue refining the use of this tool.
Next time I'll try to build reusable components and apply them in a more efficient way.

### Useful resources

I did this challenge after watching one of Traversy Media's videos about Tailwind. His channel and content are too good to be free.I did this challenge after watching one of Traversy Media's videos about Tailwind. His channel and content are too good to be free.
